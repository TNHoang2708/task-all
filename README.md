# Simple Interest Calculator

This project explains how to calculate **Simple Interest** using a basic formula.

## Formula

Simple Interest (SI) is calculated using the formula:

SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest (per year)
- T = Time (in years)

## Example

If:
- Principal (P) = 10,000
- Rate (R) = 5%
- Time (T) = 2 years

Then:

SI = (10,000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 1,000

## Description

This calculator helps users understand how simple interest works by applying the standard mathematical formula. It can be implemented easily in any programming language.
